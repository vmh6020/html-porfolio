<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hey there! I'm Hoang Vu — a beginner full-stack developer with big dreams and an even bigger love for learning.</p>

<p>I'm just starting out, but every day I dive deeper into the world of code, exploring everything from front-end magic to back-end logic. I’m passionate about technology, programming, and all things digital. Whether it's building a website or tinkering with new tools, I’m always up for the challenge.</p>

<p>Beyond the keyboard, I genuinely enjoy connecting with people, sharing ideas, and making new friends. I believe that learning is better when it’s shared, and I’m always excited to grow through conversations, collaborations, and community.</p>

<p>So if you're into tech, creativity, or just good vibes — let’s connect and build something awesome together!</p>
